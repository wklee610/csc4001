1.	Introduction of Project
         1.1	Project Overview
Our project 'Groupin' aims to provide a platform that helps consumers, who are CUHKSZ students, group things that can be done in groups at once. We also hope to create an environment in which consumers interact with consumers and a sense of community among CUHKSZ students as consumers. This kind of platform saves money and resources, saves time, and fosters a variety of social and group activities in school by helping consumers to do things jointly, which they can do together. we think we can create more group activities and a better environment.

         1.2 Objective
Our system design was inspired by popular applications such as Taobao and WeChat. Taobao is a site where we can see information about shopping and menus. WeChat is a messenger that can check user information. Utilizing these two materials, the system is divided into a front-end part, where users can use and interact with the interface, and a back-end part, where developers and servers manage data and receive and handle data transmission. Our goal is to provide a complete and convenient platform for group activities of CUHKSZ.

         1.3	Expected Customers and Market
The main target and users of our platform are all students, professors and staff with a CUHKSZ email account. With an email account, users can sign up as customers of our platform. The administrator account belongs to the administrator who operates the platform.
